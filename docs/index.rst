Welcome to Fuse's documentation!
================================

Generate wordlists using pattern logic and expressions.

Fuse is a blazing fast and robust wordlist generator that parses character classes, quantifiers, files, and numeric ranges. It brings a "regex-like" paradigm to generating precise datasets, allowing offensive security professionals and developers to generate specific password lists, payloads, or permutations from a compact syntax.

Why Fuse?
---------
* **Compact Patterns**: Describe millions of words in just a few characters.
* **Fast**: Employs mathematically optimal scaling algorithms yielding tens of thousands of words per second.
* **Smart Seeking**: Instead of streaming from the beginning, Fuse can seek directly to a specific word using ``--start`` and ``--end``, keeping memory usage constant and small.
* **Multi-threaded**: Distribute generation intelligently across up to 64 cores.
* **Scriptable**: Robust ``.fuse`` syntax allows breaking rules into easily readable macros and modules.
